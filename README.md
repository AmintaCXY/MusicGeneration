# Music Generation of Jazz Style based on Deep Learning 

 This paper studies the music generation, and constructs a jazz style music generation model and interactive platform based on deep learning. 

***

The __training__ folder is a trained model where you can use the bundled files to generate music from the command line.


In the __web__ folder is the web source file for music generation interaction. 
You can download this folder and use __start.py__ to start the server locally. The page is then used to generate music.
