# Music Generation of Jazz Style based on Deep Learning 
 This paper studies the music generation, and constructs a jazz style music generation model and interactive platform based on deep learning. 

The _training_ folder is a trained model where you can use the bundled files to generate music from the command line.

In the _web_ folder is the web source file for music generation interaction. 
You can download this folder and use _start.py_ to start the server locally. The page is then used to generate music.
